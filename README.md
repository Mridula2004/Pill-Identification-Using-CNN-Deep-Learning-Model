# Pill Identification Using CNN Deep Learning Model
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for pill identification. The model will take images of pills as input and predict their corresponding identities based on their visual features. <br />
Dataset <br />
The dataset consists of images of various pills, each labeled with their corresponding identities. The dataset will be divided into training, validation, and test sets for model training, evaluation, and testing. <br />
Model Architecture <br />
The CNN model is built using TensorFlow. The architecture will consist of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification. Techniques such as dropout and batch normalization will be employed to prevent overfitting.<br />
